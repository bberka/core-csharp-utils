# Core CSharp Utils
A simple repo that contains a simple copy paste code that provides simple utils

Basically i am tired of re-writing the same code for bunch of different projects

I will try to keep it in single .cs file. If that doesnt work for you seperate it in your project.

## What not a DLL or Nuget Package ?
Because we do not want unwanted references in our projects for simple stuff like this. Insted copy paste code gives you more power overall, easier to maintain and control.
